# Job Search Resume Matcher

Welcome! This project helps you find jobs that truly fit your resume—automatically.

## Why?
Job hunting is overwhelming. We built this tool to save you time and help you discover the best-matching jobs for your unique skills, using real natural language understanding (not just keyword matching).

## What does it do?
- Upload your resume (PDF or DOCX)
- Paste a job listings URL (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)
- The app scrapes, analyzes, and ranks jobs by how well they match your experience
- Download your results as a CSV

## How does it work?
We use modern NLP (spaCy, Sentence Transformers) to extract and compare skills, and a fast web UI (Next.js + React) for a smooth experience.

## Quick Start
See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) for full installation and troubleshooting instructions.

## Who is this for?
Anyone who wants to cut through the noise and find jobs that actually fit—job seekers, career changers, or anyone tired of manual job searching.
